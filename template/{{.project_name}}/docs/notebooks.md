# Notebooks

Python notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, visualizations, and data in a single, shareable format. They are commonly used in data science and research for executing Python code in cells, visualizing outputs (like charts), and documenting analyses with rich text, including Markdown and LaTeX. These notebooks are typically run in environments like Jupyter.
